This is a Term paper developed around veins. You can check the paper
[here]([Read more words!](LA_TCC_V1.pdf) (in portuguese).

The paper describes the development of vehicular networking technology,
its standardization and tools. Specifically, the IEEE 1609 standard is
investigated in detail. Several examples of vehicular technology
applications are given. A group of simulation tools is analyzed and
compared. When some of them are integrated, they allow vehicles to be
connected in networks. The technology is simulated and scrutinized on a
case study in a scenario in Rio de Janeiro city. Installation and
implementation guides that help creating new scenarios are attached to
this work.

This fork implements three [case studies](/caseStudy), the foundation
for [WAVE applications](src/veins/modules/waveApplication) and an
[EmergencyApplication](src/veins/modules/waveApplication/applications/EmergencyApplication.cc)
that sends emergency messages periodically requesting vehicles to give
way.
